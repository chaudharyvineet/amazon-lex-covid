# amazon-lex-covid
bot for corona virus
AWS Lex-based chatbot tries to find out if you're infected based on a series of questions asked like symptoms, recent whereabouts, and stats from the dataset. It also provides covid stats in your area, nearby hospital availability. A really simple single-page application, with clear UI accessible over a unique short URL, works well on really slow internet too, considering the bandwidth for rural areas and the importance of real-time information in early covid days.
